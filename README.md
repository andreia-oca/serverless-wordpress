# Serverless Wordpress with genezio

I am using genezio to deploy a wordpress-like blog.

This blog will contain articles about interesting tech stuff that I am encountering in my day to day exploring.
Stay tuned to read about DevOps best practices, news in security and kernel development.

## Posted articles

I am keeping the articles versioned in the `/articles` folder.

## Technical details

The project is deployed using [genezio](https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio) for deploying both the backend and frontend

All the data is hosted on a Mongo database.
